      There are more than 200 shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva in Chamoli
      district of Uttarakhand itself, the most important one is Kedarnath.
      According to legend, the Pandavas after having won over the Kauravas in
      the Kurukshetra war, felt guilty of having killed their own Kith and Kin
      and sought blessings of Lord Shiva for redemption. He eluded them
      repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a
      bull.

      On being followed, the Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the
      surface at Kedarnath. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva appeared at
      four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations. The arms
      of the Lord appeared at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the belly at
      Madmaheshwar and his locks (hair) with head at Kalpeshwar. The Kedarnath
      and four above mentioned shrines are treated as Panch Kedar (Panch means
      Five in Sanskrit).

      The Temple at Kedarnath presents an imposing sight, standing in middle of
      a wide plateau surrounded by lofty snow covered peaks. The temple was
      originally built in 8th century A.D. by Jagad Guru Adi Shankaracharya and
      stands adjacent to site of an even earlier temple built by the Pandavas.
      The inner walls of the assembly hall are decorated with figures of various
      deities and scenes from mythology. Outside the temple door a large statue
      of the Nandi bull stands as guard.

    <p>
      Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Kedarnath temple has exquisite architecture
      Built of extremely large, heavy and evenly cut grey slabs of stones, it
      evokes wonder as to how these heavy slabs were moved and handled in the
      earlier centuries. The temple has a Garbha Griha for worship and a Mandap,
      apt for assemblies of pilgrims and visitors. A conical rock formation
      inside the temple is worshipped as Lord Shiva in his Sadashiva form.
